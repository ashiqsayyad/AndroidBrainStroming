4)Go to your homepage (click on jfrog icon)and click Add New Repository button and Add new repository

Now lets upload our aar on our maven repo

First Approach -

1) Add the following code under the root build.gradle file:
classpath 'com.novoda:bintray-release:{latest_version}'
Latest version can be found at https://github.com/novoda/bintray-release/releases

2) Add project details to the build.gradle file under the /app directory
apply plugin: ‘com.android.library’
publish {

    def groupProjectID = '{package_name}'
    def artifactProjectID = '{name_of_your_library}'
    def publishVersionID = 'library_version_code'

    userOrg = '{username_of_bintray}'
    repoName = 'repository_name'
    groupId = groupProjectID
    artifactId = artifactProjectID
    publishVersion = publishVersionID
    desc = '{library description}'
    website = '{github_url}

}

//example is at

apply plugin: 'com.novoda.bintray-release'
apply plugin: 'com.android.library'



//Step II: Add the below publish details
publish {

     def groupProjectID = 'com.ashiqsample.networklib'
        def artifactProjectID = 'networklib'
        def publishVersionID = '1.0.0'

    userOrg = 'ashiqsayyad'
    repoName = 'ashiqrepo'
    groupId = com.ashiqsample.networklib
    artifactId = networklib
    publishVersion = 1.0.0
    desc = 'Android library for displaying data based on JSON configuration fetched from server. With this library, you can kiss goodbye to string.xml, dimen.xml, arrays.xml. Keep all your string/integer/array config in one file. The library will automatically fetch the data from the url you provide.'
    website = 'https://github.com/ashiqsayyad/AndroidBrainStroming'
}

Finally run below command to upload aar to ur repo
>gradlew bintrayUpload -PbintrayUser=ashiqsayyad -PbintrayKey=d1f175df330d9c0a263f7dcec37b480839c306c7 -PdryRun=false
